# HandwrittenLatinTranslator
Takes an image of handwritten or typed Latin text and then parses and translates it. The system is far from perfect but this project has been an interesting process to think about.

The training dataset, *emnist-byclass-train*, is too big to be uploaded but it can be found at this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/emnist)

**IN PROGRESS**
